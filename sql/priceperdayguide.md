i have created an app that crawls a website an records price of products once or twice a week. each price is stored in sqlite3 with a DATETIME value.  How do I query all prices per day and include days where I dont have a record?

To retrieve all prices per day, including days without a record, you can use the following steps. I'll assume you want to include days where there are no records and display them with a NULL value for the price.

    Generate a Date Range:
    To include days without records, you'll first need to create a date range that covers the period you're interested in.

    sql

WITH DateRange AS (
    SELECT MIN(DATE(price_date)) AS start_date, MAX(DATE(price_date)) AS end_date
    FROM your_table_name
)

Generate a Series of Dates:
Use the date range to generate a series of dates that covers the entire range. You can use a recursive common table expression (CTE) or a temporary table for this.

sql

, DateSeries AS (
    SELECT start_date + (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY start_date) - 1) AS date
    FROM DateRange
    CONNECT BY start_date + (ROWNUM - 1) <= end_date
)

Left Join with Price Data:
Now, left join the date series with your price data to include days without records.

sql

    SELECT DateSeries.date, COALESCE(price, NULL) AS price
    FROM DateSeries
    LEFT JOIN your_table_name ON DateSeries.date = DATE(your_table_name.price_date)

    This query uses COALESCE to replace NULL values with a default value (in this case, NULL) for better readability.

Putting it all together:

sql

WITH DateRange AS (
    SELECT MIN(DATE(price_date)) AS start_date, MAX(DATE(price_date)) AS end_date
    FROM your_table_name
),
DateSeries AS (
    SELECT start_date + (ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY start_date) - 1) AS date
    FROM DateRange
    CONNECT BY start_date + (ROWNUM - 1) <= end_date
)
SELECT DateSeries.date, COALESCE(price, NULL) AS price
FROM DateSeries
LEFT JOIN your_table_name ON DateSeries.date = DATE(your_table_name.price_date);

This query will give you a list of dates and corresponding prices, including days without records. Adjust table and column names accordingly.

Q1: How can you optimize this query for better performance, especially when dealing with a large dataset?

Q2: Are there any potential drawbacks or limitations to using the recursive approach for generating the date series?

Q3: In what scenarios might it be beneficial to store additional information along with the date and price in your SQLite database?
